# Style Transfer for ml5/tf.js and video using Paperspace Gradient

This notebook can be used to train a style transfer model, convert it to a ml5 compatible one and/or use it to perform video style transfer all using Paperspace Gradient notebooks. 

Paperspace Gradient offers a free GPU instance with their notebooks that you can run up to 6 hours at a time. You just need a free account. It is one of the easiest and most accessible ways to do machine learning, especially if you do not have a top-end GPU.

This notebook is based on the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TZNdhoUEBoxQqY5EFloZcuyYUs9oNQ-g), provided by ml5 and adapted so it works with Gradient.

It excludes downloading of the 14GB+ COCO image dataset, since it is already provided by Paperspace.  

NOTE: For this notebook to work, the Paperspace Docker image must be TensorFlow 1.14.

Enjoy!
